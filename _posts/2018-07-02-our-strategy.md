To reach this goal by leapfrogging, we believe we should achieve leadership in all sectors through transforming youngsters into role models.  We are deeply committed to building a civil society which can provide the solutions and the role models.  We reckon that the people in the society generally shape their opinions, thought and habits along the lines of the leaders they see in various walks of life.  Therefore, if there are enough role models and leaders in a given neighborhood, it will make the community environment healthy and ready to rise to the challenges. In an environment where unnecessary dominance and hierarchies are eliminated, the society will automatically be a level playing field.  
Thus, the EQuality Empowerment Centre carries itself in a manner which builds the Subject Knowledge, Skills in Application and a strong Value System in individuals.  This dais is for the sake of wisdom, equity and courage that is necessary in each person to lead a balanced life and for the harmony in the Society.
