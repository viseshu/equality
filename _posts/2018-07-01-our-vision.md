excerpt: Needs, Thoughts and Emotions are essentially the exclusive considerations when Humans are born.  Gradually, comprehension and discretion develops through the experiences ever since.  The logic and rationale is limited to the horizons of the thought process. Hence the decision-making follows this order.

 The resultant interests and actions become part of the Personality.  In this evolutionary order, humans gain Knowledge, Skills and Character. These three components are mutually dependent to decide Right from Wrong.
In this Universe, Life has time limits; Physical and Emotional abilities have an evolutionary cycle all of which transform the wisdom and the attitude in various ways defining the human living.  In the course of human history, the fortunes of excellent wisdom of mankind has introduced amazing resources, comforts, tools and ideas to the entire family of life species of the Planet while causing the rise of cruel bias, destructive systems and natural calamities.

In view of this, we ought to analyze our successes and failures. Assessing our strengths and weaknesses relentlessly; using them appropriately for living a rational, equitable and unbiased life style is the essence of a happy and ideal living.  Therefore, our systems and functioning styles should follow the principle of a Universal Family. Treat others the way you want to be treated.  Isnâ€™t that the essence of all faiths?  Our systems and skills are meaningful only when the weakest of us is completely secure physically and emotionally.  Otherwise, they are part of the Problem.  No power is noteworthy if it does not help the powerless.
Not only individually; but also collectively, Humans have always been trying modern and amazing tools, instruments, mechanisms, processes and systems to improve the quality of life.  But, there is one obvious crippling failure.. That is Bias.  Any step of human race taken forward with prejudice to the individual or the group is regressive and not easy to undo.


The truth is, no two are equal in this Universe. It is that diversity that separates one from the other and provides an identity for every individual. We may not be equal, but we are equally diverse. Nothing makes one more important than the other.  Therefore, we need to believe in Equality, as a way of treatment, in order to be fair.  The real problem stems from the Bias that creeps into our choices.  The origin of bias is unwarranted order of preference that results from unnecessary comparison.  If the comparison is necessary and sufficient, it is only fair.  If not, it is Prejudice.  If you are special, everyone else is special too.  The prejudice thus results in extreme consequences and atrocities.  If we are not careful enough, each one of us can be biased to the extent of our own inappropriate application of experiences, opinions and knowledge.  There is another equally dangerous weapon in human traits.  That is Control.  Exercising necessary control does help in achieving a degree of certainty over the result.  On the contrary, if for any reason, we tend to control others unnecessarily and totally, it is counterproductive and a cause for concern.
In order to lead lives beyond unnecessary bias and control, we need to make a habit of following complex and critical reasoning in our processes and systems. 

The relations and relationships should not become restrictions for a clear and correct judgment.  Not everything we see, hear and feel is necessarily true.  Veracity and Equity are the final standards.  Empowering people to this level of equanimity is the main commitment of EQuality. The optimum balance of knowledge, skills and character in individuals and groups is essentially the Vision of EQuality.
