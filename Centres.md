Our first Study Center is coming up in Markapur Village, Prakasam District, Andhra Pradesh

We are building a physical space with class rooms, study place with chrome books, internet and library to access all the content related to the competitive exams.

We assist with graduation, facilitate scholarships and counselling the youth of the village to take up government jobs. We also teach spoken English, life skills and IT skills -  these are real-world skills that increase self-confidence and employability.
